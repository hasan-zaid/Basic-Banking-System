# Basic-Banking-System

A basic banking created using Python. It enables the admin to login and create customer bank accounts. Accounts can either be savings or current. Each has slightly different restrictions regarding withdrawal.

- Run the "main.py" file
- check "admins.txt" and "customers.txt" files for login credentials
- Browse through this little system as you wish 

Fun fact, this was my first programming project :)
